## Metadata
Digital Collections are built on metadata! For discoverable, useful collections, use consistent, justifiable metadata elements. All collections should follow some guidelines. For the collections like the [Smith Papers](https://smithpapers.github.io), we are providing our [metadata guidelines](https://github.com/DeepSouthDH/deepsouthdh.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/metadata-guidelines-202107.pdf) for an example and the [metadata template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ARQ-7A3KTBe0Nah1Ktl6on1DRkL5-FFs/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108103280018141344202&rtpof=true&sd=true), which can be copied. (To use the template, open the link and click File > Make a Copy.) 

## Funding
Cultural heritage and public humanities projects often require funding. Below are some possible agencies to consult for funding these opportunities. We are also providing our grant [narrative](https://github.com/DeepSouthDH/deepsouthdh.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/MHC-grantapp-narrative-DSDH.pdf) and [budget](https://github.com/DeepSouthDH/deepsouthdh.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/MHC-grantapp-budget-DSDH.pdf) for getting Deep South DH off the ground.

## Smith Papers Resources

The Smith Papers Project is built using the [Collection Builder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) framework and hosted on Github pages. The Smith Papers project is also the basis for "LIB 201: Intro to Digital Research," a course taught at MUW. The [LIB 201 course page](https://github.com/hillaryAHR/LIB-201) provides tutorials and pedagogical insights for network analyses, maps, timelines, text analyses, and narrative exhibits.
