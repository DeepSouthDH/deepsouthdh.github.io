To kick-off the beginning of Deep South DH, Fant Library will host a panel and workshop to discuss the importance of digitizing lesser-known collections, such as family letters, to the overall scholarship of women's lives and history. 

Panelists Dr. Suzanne Marrs, Dr. Bridget Pieschel, and Ms. Angela Stewart will share personal experiences with scholarship using letters by women. Following the panel will be a workshop on the processes and significance of digitizing items, including a demonstration. The demonstration will be led by faculty in Fant Library and the Columbus-Lowndes Public Library Archivist. 

This hybrid workshop/panel will be the beginning of many more discussions on how collections such as these can be a significant addition to the litany of resources used for studying the lives, influences, and history of Mississippi Women.
