This collection highlight comes from the Center from an ongoing collaboration between University of Southern Mississippi's Center for Digital Humanities and the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. Read more about the featured exhibits in their project, and how teachers, scholars, and Mississippians of all backgrounds might interact with and learn from these collections. Our feature is posted <a href="https://deepsouthdh.github.io/projects/">here</a>, or visit the Digital Snapshots site directly at https://dh-mdah.com/exhibits.
