Deep South DH's first highlighted collection is the Smith Papers Collection.

With the students in the Digital Studies Minor at Mississippi University for Women, we are digitizing and sharing letters from the [Ellard-Murphree-Pilgreen-Smith Family](https://athenacommons.muw.edu/smithpapers) Papers ("Smith Papers") Collection.  This treasure trove of more than 6000 letters and 90 journals from three generations of "W" women and their families is a new and rich resource for studying the Mississippi middle class over the twentieth century.  

This collection is also a sandbox for learning and experimenting with Digital Humanities tools and methods. Deep South DH hopes to share the tools, methods, and documentation from various derivative projects through workshops, websites, and an upcoming intensive institute.
