beta release of DSDH jekyll site


##### This is an in-progress Deep South DH jekyll page

To get up and running:
 - DAN: GIT INIT STUFF HERE PLZ K THX
 - first download the repo by navigating to a directory and cloning the repo (`git clone`).
 - make your changes and push your code! (`git add .` , `git commit -m 'your message'`, `git push origin main`)
 - now that you have an existing repo, you need to keep it updated. As others make changes you can keep your branch up-to-date with the main branch with `git pull`


To get these pages running, install necessary gems then serve the page (navigate to correct folder and type following commands):
 - `gem install jekyll bundler`
 - `bundle exec jekyll serve`


 Serve defaults to http://127.0.0.1:4000

Will update this documentation in the coming weeks, however, in the meantime, feel free to reach out to me with any questions!
